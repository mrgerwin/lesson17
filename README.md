Using a crop similator to explore Object Oriented Programming

Go to [https://pythonschool.net/oop/creating-your-first-class/](https://pythonschool.net/oop/creating-your-first-class/)
Create a program called crop_class.py and follow the videos on the website to program the crop class.

You are responsible for completing Tasks 1-5.  We will skip task 6.

Upload your completed Task 5 to your github repository.

### Discussion Questions:

1. In the video, the programmer insisted on keeping most of the data private.  What would happen in the user could change the growth_rate to a value that doesn't make sense like the letter "r"?  Explain why.

2. When a crop is initialized the growth and days_growing are set to 0.  Why does this make sense?

3. Do all methods of a class need to have "self" as an input variable?  Explain.
